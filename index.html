    <h2>What lasagna is a how to make it!</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that has gained worldwide popularity for its rich and comforting flavors. It is a layered pasta dish made with flat rectangular sheets of pasta, typically alternating with layers of meat sauce, cheese, and various fillings. The pasta sheets are typically boiled until al dente before being assembled with the other ingredients. The meat sauce, often made with ground beef, onions, garlic, and tomatoes, is cooked to a thick and savory consistency. Generous amounts of cheese, such as mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan, are interspersed between the layers, adding a creamy and indulgent element to the dish. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the flavors meld together to create a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>

    <p>Making lasagna from scratch is a labor of love that rewards with a truly delicious and comforting meal. To prepare a classic meat lasagna, begin by browning ground beef in a large skillet along with onions and garlic until cooked through and fragrant. Add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, herbs like basil and oregano, salt, and pepper to create a rich and flavorful meat sauce. In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, grated Parmesan, and chopped fresh parsley to make the cheese mixture. To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles. Add a layer of the cheese mixture and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella. Repeat these layers until you run out of ingredients, ensuring the final layer is cheese and mozzarella. Bake the lasagna in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30-40 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving, and enjoy the comforting layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese that make lasagna an all-time favorite dish.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat until fully cooked. Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Simmer the meat sauce for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, prepare the cheese mixture by combining the ricotta cheese, eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped fresh parsley. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles on top of the meat sauce, ensuring they cover the entire surface.</li>
        <li>Spread about one-third of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a sprinkling of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers with meat sauce, noodles, cheese mixture, and mozzarella, until all the ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it is loosely tented to allow room for the lasagna to expand while baking.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the top to brown slightly.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the layers to set.</li>
